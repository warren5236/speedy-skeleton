#Speedy Skeleton Application

The goals for the Speedy Skeleton Application are to:

* **Provide a Fast Setup** - Getting started should be as simple as downloading the skeleton, configuring your virtual host, and starting to code.
* **Deployment Module ** - It's hard to deploy sites and we make it easier by providing a quick simple way to make sure your devel database gets pushed to your production database.
* **Reports Module** - Reports can be difficult.  We provide an extensible way to create additional reports.


##Other Libraries Used in the SSA

* [jQuery](jquery.com) - Provides a nicer interface to ECMAscript (JavaScript)
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) - Provides several nice UI elements and animations that we use extensively.
* [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) - Provides a responsive, mobile-friendly boilerplate.
