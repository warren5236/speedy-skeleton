#Speedy Skeleton Application

The goals for the Speedy Skeleton Application(SSA) are to:

* **Provide Fast Setup** - Getting started should be as simple as downloading the skeleton, configuring your virtual host, and starting to code application specific code.  End of story.  None of this creating a user module and layout for every site.
* **Provide Generic Models and Controllers** - Using the [Speedy Library](https://github.com/warren5236/speedy) we will provide helpful classes to get your application deployed immediately.
* **B or Higher in Y-Slow** - Yahoo's [Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html/) has a companion plugin that will rate the site from F to A.  Our goal is to get a B or higher out of the box.
* **Provide Module Support** - The Zend Framework 1 has issues with the way it supports modules (some of these are fixed in version 2) but we wanted to provide tools that help you segregate your codes into modules faster.

##Future Modules
* **Deployment Module** - It's hard to deploy sites and we make it easier by providing a simple way to make sure your devel database gets pushed to your production database.
* **Reports Module** - Reports can be difficult.  We provide an extensible way to create additional reports.

##Other Libraries Used in the SSA

* [jQuery](jquery.com) - Provides a nicer interface to ECMAscript (JavaScript)
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) - Provides several nice UI elements and animations that we use extensively.
* [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) - Provides a responsive, mobile-friendly boilerplate.
